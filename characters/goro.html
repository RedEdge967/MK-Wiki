      <p>Goro is a fictional character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. He debuted as the sub-boss of the original 1992 Mortal Kombat and has also been featured as a sub-boss in the home ports of Mortal Kombat 4 (1997), the 2011 reboot, and Mortal Kombat X (2015). The character is a Shokan, a half-human, half-dragon race distinguished by their four arms and enormous size. Goro begins the series as champion of the eponymous Mortal Kombat tournament, a title he has held for 500 years. He is generally depicted in a villainous role, fighting for Outworld against Earthrealm's warriors.An iconic figure in the franchise, Goro is regarded as one of the most memorable and difficult bosses in video game history. He has appeared in various media outside of the games.</p>
      <h3>Powers and Abilities</h3>
      <p>Goro is one of the most powerful warriors in the history of Mortal Kombat, being able to win 9 consecutive Mortal Kombat tournaments, as well as defeating the Great Kung Lao in his first tournament - which Shang Tsung, in his younger form, couldn't do. He also served as commander of Outworld's armies, crushing rebellions and aiding in the conquest of many new realms for the Emperor.Goro's fighting style always revolved around taking advantage of his brute strength and surprising agility. In the early games, Goro was an imbalanced character. All of his moves did far more damage than all of the other characters, and because of that, he was notoriously difficult to defeat in the first game. In the 3D games, he was toned down to make him more balanced. His current depiction is being powerful, but slow. Goro is associated with the element of Fire. Like Kintaro, he could either project fireballs either from his mouth or his hands. In Shaolin Monks, he was able to shoot one fireball from each hand. He could also manipulate fire in his hands if he needed to attack using them.</p>
