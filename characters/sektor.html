      <p>Sektor is a fictional character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. He debuted in Mortal Kombat 3 (1995) as a cyborg warrior of the fictional Lin Kuei clan. Sektor is depicted as the villainous counterpart to his fellow Lin Kuei cyborg Cyrax, seeking domination through his own cybernetic clan.The character has also been featured in other Mortal Kombat media, including the animated series Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm (1996) and the web series Mortal Kombat: Legacy (2011â€“2013). He has received mostly positive reception for his Fatality finishing moves and personality, although his gameplay has received a more mixed response.</p>
      <h3>Powers and Abilities</h3>
      <p>As a "cybernetic organism", Sektor possesses enhanced strength and stamina, as well as great onboard weaponry. As with the case of Cyrax, he appears to specialize in long range combat. His chest cavity is loaded with rockets and heat-seeking missiles. Unlike the other cyborgs, Sektor embraced his new machine body and decided to upgrade it rather than remove it. As of Armageddon, he commands an entire squad of AI controlled machines built in a similar vein to his original design as well as Cyrax's new design. Due to his upgrades, he possesses a jet propulsion system on each of his joints and new armor plating. He also now has two pulse blades to verse his foes in close quarter combat if needed to.
