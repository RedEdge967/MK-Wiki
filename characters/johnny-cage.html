      <h3>Johnny Cage</h3>
      <img align="center" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7b/Johnny_Render_mk_11.png">
      <p>Johnny Cage is a fictional character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. Introduced in the original 1992 game, he is an action movie star with an extensive martial arts background. The series depicts Cage as one of the primary heroes defending Earthrealm from various threats, as well as the comic foil. In the rebooted timeline, Cage is also the love interest to Special Forces officer Sonya Blade and the father of their daughter Cassie. He is inspired by martial arts star Jean-Claude Van Damme, particularly Van Damme's character in the 1988 film Bloodsport.A staple of the franchise, Cage has appeared in various media outside of the games. Reception to the character has been generally positive for his role in the series, character development, gameplay, and Fatality finishing moves.</p>
      <h3>Powers and Abilities</h3>
      <p>Despite his air-headed and superficial demeanor, Johnny Cage is a strong and agile warrior, showing an excellent fighting technique during battle. After long periods of training with various masters of martial arts, Cage himself has acquired mastery of several fighting styles, such as the famous Karate. He is also trained in the use of firearms and military equipment ranging from pistols to armored tanks.Although Cage is a human being, he possesses superhuman powers. According to MK 2011, Johnny descended from a Mediterranean cult that bred warriors for the gods: warriors with special abilities. One of these is the ability to propel himself forward and increase the strength of his blows. When Cage uses this power, afterimages of a green color are produced. Cage can augment the power of these shadow attacks, which are represented by afterimages of a red color. In addition to these physical shadow abilities, Cage also has the ability to launch blasts of energy.As shown in the Story Mode of Mortal Kombat X, Cage can also harness this energy and encase his body with it, strong enough to withstand a death blow from Shinnok without receiving any injury to his person. This energy was also potent enough to allow him to fight on equal terms with the Elder God. Raiden theorized that this power can only come about when the want arises to protect a loved one from imminent danger.Cage is one of the few kombatants to utilize unorthodox tactics alongside Erron Black. Similar to the enemy gunslinger, he utilizes odd weaponry such as a camera that emits flashes of light that disorients others and a pair of explosive sunglasses. He has a tendency to implement Hollywood inspired attacks into his fighting styles, such as creating clones known as Stunt Doubles (he uses actual stunt doubles in later installments) to attack his enemies and using props as deadly weapons. Cage is also infamous for his signature "Nut Punch" attack, which he proudly flaunts for its effectiveness despite the condemnation of those around him.</p>
