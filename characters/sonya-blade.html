      <h3>Sonya Blade</h3>
      <img align="center" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/72/Sonya_MK_11.png">
      <p>Sonya Blade is a fictional character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. She debuted in the original 1992 game as the roster's sole female fighter. Inspired by martial artist Cynthia Rothrock, she is a military officer with the Special Forces.In the storyline of the games, Sonya becomes involved with the eponymous Mortal Kombat tournament through pursuit of her archenemy, the criminal leader Kano. She subsequently joins the warriors defending Earthrealm and establishes a government agency dedicated to battling otherworldly threats. The series' rebooted timeline also depicts her as the love interest to martial arts actor Johnny Cage and the mother of their daughter Cassie.A mainstay of the franchise, Sonya has also appeared in various media outside of the games. Reception to the character has been generally positive, with respect to her role as one of Mortal Kombat's primary female fighters.</p>
      <h3>Powers and Abilities</h3>
      <p>Sonya has the power to fire and manipulate projectiles made of pink-colored energy (in MK 2011, the ability seems to not be magical in origin, but more an effect of using a high-tech weapon attached to her wrists), as well as gain temporary flight (or at the very least the ability to maneuver in air). Her abilities are vast, mostly based on agility, as well as deadly and impressive due to her Special Forces training. She is very fast in combat, using quick and effective kicks and strikes. She also incorporates gymnastics into some of her moves, such as her Kartwheel Kick move and Scissor Split fatality. She is also, along with Liu Kang, Nightwolf, Johnny Cage, Jax, Sub-Zero, Smoke, Kabal and Stryker, one of Raiden's Chosen Warriors (being the only Earthrealm female with this honor until the inclusion of later warriors) and thus, one of the strongest fighters not only in Earthrealm, but all the realms.In MKX, her Covert Ops variation focuses on hand-to-hand combat and brings back some of her classic moves. The Demolition variation gives her frag and stun grenades to use against the opponent in various ways including, but she can only have up to three of them stored before having to call in a Drone to give her more. The Special Forces variation allows her to call in this drone and command it to attack the opponent in multiple ways with its arsenal which includes a fully automatic machine gun, flamethrower, self-destructive mode, grenade launcher, rocket launcher, electroshock weapon and laser cannons.In MK11, she has a mobile sentry gun known as BUD-E (known as KAT in the move list) armed with a cannon chambered in .50 caliber rounds that can switch between semi auto and automatic fire mode. The drone has less weapon options than her previous drone, but it is used with different tactics in battle. BUD-E acts as a turret, being able to shoot and walk, but can also jump to tackle the opponent to the ground. It can also be used for surprise attacks by airdropping the drone above the unsuspecting opponent, crushing them under its weight and accumulated kinetic energy. Her drone still retains the ability to self-destruct with an explosion.</p>
