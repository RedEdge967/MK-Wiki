      <img align="center" src="https://mk11moves.com/img/characters/crops/jax-briggs.png">
      <p>Jackson "Jax" Briggs is a fictional character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. Introduced in Mortal Kombat II (1993) as the leader of a Special Forces unit, he became a mainstay of the series, including as the protagonist of the action-adventure spin-off Mortal Kombat: Special Forces (2000). The character is distinguished by his metal bionic arms, which he first received in Mortal Kombat 3 (1995), and his abilities are based around his upper-body strength.In the games, Jax is first depicted as the commanding officer of Special Forces operative Sonya Blade and subsequently becomes one of the warriors defending Earthrealm from various threats. He is also depicted as a primary hero in various related media, including the 1996 animated series Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm, the 1997 film Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, and the 2011 web series Mortal Kombat: Legacy. Reception to the character has been generally positive for his appearance and special moves.</p>
      <h3>Powers and Abilities</h3>
      <p>Due to his membership in the army, Jax is quite a hardened soldier on the battlefield. He is known to show incredible ferocity while staying focused at the same time. Jax's most prominent attribute is his massive upper body strength. His physique and strength are so powerful that he is able to crush human heads with ease and shake the earth with a single punch. His muscle power was great enough for him to even create purple shockwaves and launch them at the enemy.From Mortal Kombat 3 onwards, Jax utilizes cybernetic strength enhancers to further augment his already impressive physical power. These implants also carry portable missiles, energy enhancers, nanokinetic metalmorphation and a piston-like mechanism to increase the force of his blows. In later Mortal Kombat games, the cybernetics would come with further augmentations, like a rocket-propelled punch or a plasma shell discharge which he could launch individually or consecutively from both fists.In various Mortal Kombat games, Jax would also incorporate modern weaponry into his fighting style to compliment the cybernetic augmentations he'd received. Often times employing sub-machine guns, grenade and rocket launchers as well as RPG's along with his melee. In Mortal Kombat 11, Jax has able to heat up his Bionic Arms every time he lands a punch, doing this will increase the damage of his bionic arms and gain an ability to shoot projectiles from his fist.Aside from his kombat skills, Jax is also a competent technician, scientist and engineer, having been in charge of the portal development technology that the Outworld Investigation Agency uses to move between realms on top of the special development of the SF's bionic enhancement program. He was also responsible for restoring Cyrax' free will following the cyborg ninja's defection from the Lin Kuei.</p>
