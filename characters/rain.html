      <p>Rain is a fictional character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. He debuted as a playable character in home ports of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (1995) after appearing in the arcade version's attract mode. Rain is a royal demigod from the fictional realm of Edenia whose desire for power leads to him aligning with the franchise's villains. As implied by his name, his powers center around water manipulation. Originally depicted as a purple palette swap of the series' male ninjas, the character is a homage to American musician Prince.Reception to the character has been mixed, with some critics regarding him as lacking distinguishing features from the franchise's earlier ninja characters.</p>
      <h3>Powers and Abilities</h3>
      <p>Being the half-God he is, Rain wields immense power. Rain can control two things that involve weather: water and lightning. His powers being related to such, he is able to pressurize jet streams of water to either propel himself or slice his opponents like a blade. Rain's control over water and lightning is so powerful he can create massive storm clouds to block out the sun from the sky. He is most noted for his ability to trap opponents in a spherical prison of water that gives him limited control over their body. In addition, he is able to conjure up lightning blasts from the sky to blast his opponents into the air. He also possesses the ability to liquefy himself, turning himself into water and reconstituting behind them in a swift manner akin to teleporting. Through mysterious means, he enchants the strength in his legs, distorting space to strike them so hard that they would reappear opposite to his direction.In Mortal Kombat 11, Rain now wields a jamadhar, a katar consisting of three blades with the middle blade being hidden by two retracting blades. His powers and the backstory behind most of them have been heavily expanded on as well. He now has the ability to open dimensional rifts into the previously unexplored water realm. This allows him to create two different kinds of portals: a portal made out of water and one that has a purple color with a yellowish outline. The latter is often used in combat to teleport opponents after being launched by an attack, but he can also use it as a deadly projectile as well as imbue his attacks with it. Even his hydrokinesis has been expanded, as he can now create deadly weapons out of highly pressurized water and even summon tidal waves to wash away his opponents. His ability to turn into water has also been expanded considerably, being able to reshape himself into an orb to snag his enemies into the air and slam them into the ground or shift into his liquid state to either slip past his opponents or allow attacks to pass through his form harmlessly.</p>
