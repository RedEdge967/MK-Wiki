      <p>Rain is a fictional character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. He debuted as a playable character in home ports of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (1995) after appearing in the arcade version's attract mode. Rain is a royal demigod from the fictional realm of Edenia whose desire for power leads to him aligning with the franchise's villains. As implied by his name, his powers center around water manipulation. Originally depicted as a purple palette swap of the series' male ninjas, the character is a homage to American musician Prince.Reception to the character has been mixed, with some critics regarding him as lacking distinguishing features from the franchise's earlier ninja characters.</p>
