      <h3>Cyrax</h3>

      <p>Cyrax is a fictional character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. He debuted in Mortal Kombat 3 (1995) as a cyborg warrior of the fictional Lin Kuei clan. Cyrax is depicted as the heroic counterpart to his fellow Lin Kuei cyborg Sektor, eventually regaining his humanity and joining the Special Forces in their defense of Earthrealm.The character has also been featured in other Mortal Kombat media, including the 1996 animated series Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm, the 1997 film Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, and the 2011 web series Mortal Kombat: Legacy. He has received mostly positive reception, particularly for his Fatality finishing moves and gameplay.</p>
      <h3>Powers and Abilities</h3>
      <p>As a cybernetic ninja, Cyrax is well-equipped, both in martial arts involving ninjutsu and weaponry. Cyrax houses a number of weapons in his chest cavity designed for both incapacitating and destroying targets. Of the three cyborg ninjas, Cyrax is most associated with bombardment, his arsenal full of timed explosives with a seemingly unlimited supply. He also has access to an 'energy net' capable of incapacitating his targets completely. When his soul was returned to him, not only did Cyrax retain some of his cybernetic parts, he was also outfitted with state-of-the-art technology, courtesy of the Outworld Investigation Agency. Cyrax was now equipped with a portable device that would allow him to freely traverse across the realms without the need of stationary portals. In addition, his armor is heat-resistant, as he was able to completely submerge himself in molten rock without severely damaging himself in the process. His net weapon was replaced with a buzzsaw-like appendage, used for mid-range combat. Cyrax is also able to relocate himself across short distances by separating all of his limbs and head as his torso would transport to a different area where all of the discarded limbs would rejoin.In Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, Cyrax fires a similar net, but it is compromised of nanomachines that completely eat the flesh, blood, and organs of any unlucky targets, completely destroying them without even leaving the marrow behind.</p>
