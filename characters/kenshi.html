He debuted in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance (2002) as a blind swordsman and operative for the Special Forces. In addition to his sword skills, he possesses telekinetic abilities.Outside of the games, Kenshi has appeared in various related media. Reception to the character has been positive for his design, special moves, and overcoming his personal handicap. He is regarded as the best fighter from the 3D era of Mortal Kombat games and is one of the few that has remained in the series since the transition back to 2D.</p>
      <h3>Powers and Abilities</h3>
      <p>Despite his blindness, Kenshi possesses senses that are heightened beyond their normal ability and can fight on par with any other kombatant. Kenshi wields an ancestral sword that contains the spirits of warrior kings from his line, and he is in turn guided by these spirits in combat. He can sense an opponent's presence by their energy or by hearing them and thus, can take opponents by surprise. His senses are so acute, he is capable of sensing beings capable of hiding from well trained assassins such as Sub-Zero and can even sense beings sealed in objects such as Shinnok who was trapped in his own amulet that leads to a dark dimension. His sense of sight is revealed to be spiritual in nature, meaning that he can sense the souls of living beings. Also due to his blindness, he is completely immune to attacks that would target one's sense of sight.Kenshi is well-trained in telekinesis as well, frequently using it to move objects and people without physically touching them. His telekinetic attacks allow him to push, pull and lift most things using a single hand motion. He is also capable of teleportation and levitation, further increasing his mobility. Mileena and others have described him having other psychic talents on top of his TK abilities. Throughout the years, the blind swordsman has also showcased other skills pertaining to a mentalist. Like telepathy, through which he can project waves of energy from his mind that can paralyze, keeping enemies in place and stopping their movements which leaves them open to attack. Kenshi has demonstrated several abilities using such a power that are useful outside of physical combat, like the transmission of thoughts and reading minds, seeing visions of the future in his dreams, removing mind control effects on others, creating portals with an incantation, and being able to overload one's senses which causes a knockout.In MK 2011, Kenshi's fighting style has been expanded upon, extensively using his telekinesis to wield his sword, although he still uses his hands to hold it from time to time. He can also employ his telekinesis into a tangible, projection of himself to attack opponents from a distance, similar to Noob Saibot. His sword has the ability to reflect projectiles back to his opponents as well as being able to magically absorb projectiles that will replenish his health.In MKX, one of Kenshi's variations, Possessed, features a shattered version of the Sento and through these cracks, he is able to summon forth a Demon that wields a large sickle and Kwan Dao that fights for Kenshi on Kenshi's demand.</p>
