      <h3>Jacqui Briggs</h3>
      <img align="center" src="">
      <p>A close friend to Cassie Cage, Jacqui Briggs is the daughter of Jackson Briggs and Vera Briggs. After Jax was resurrected from being one of Quan Chi's slaves during the Netherrealm War, he met Vera and they went onto marry, becoming parents to Jacque. After her birth, he became overly protective of Jacqui and wanted her to live a normal life. At some point, Jacqui became a professional kickboxer and eventually competed in the Junior Olympics and enlisted in a training camp. Despite her father not approving her decision to join the Special Forces, Jacqui sees it as her duty to protect Earthrealm and to avenge her father from the suffering he endured from Quan Chi and Ermac (who ripped off Jax's arms during the Outworld tournament).Jacqui enjoys the time she spends with Cassie, but was often annoyed by her friend's lack of hindsight in their youth and is often the voice of reason when the two get into predicaments. During missions, Jacqui becomes very serious and supports Cassie’s leadership. Jacqui is very protective of her family, but is easily annoyed whenever her father’s history of being Quan Chi's slave is brought up, as shown when Kung Jin continues to do so. Most recently, she has become romantically involved with Takeda Takahashi, Kenshi’s son and Scorpion’s apprentice.In Mortal Kombat X she is a Specialist and is promoted to Sergeant by the time of Mortal Kombat 11. In addition to this, it is revealed that Jacqui and Takeda are engaged, through dialogue intros with Scorpion.</p>
      <h3>Powers and Abilities</h3>
      <p>Jacqui is a trained Junior grade Olympic boxer, able to go toe-to-toe with Cassie and knock a grown man unconscious with her bare hands. Her fighting skills were further developed through Special Forces training.She uses a pair of electronic gauntlets that greatly enhance her physical strength and can fire plasma energy, shotgun rounds, or machine gun rounds and rockets, depending on her variation.As of MK11, Jacqueline now sports augmented digitized leg additions which work in unison with her bionic arm guards. They serve to increase her kicking power and lower body mobility in conjunction with her gauntlets, allowing her to deliver several high speed energized kicks in an instant.On top of the lower body armor, her upgraded equipment can further augment her physical melee by channeling energized currents through her limbs in order to further augment her impressive brawling power.Ms. Briggs also better incorporates more of the advanced weapons tech of Earthrealm's outer world response agency in battle. Making greater use of explosives and barrier generator technologies in conjunction with the chaingun function of her augmentative bracers. Said gauntlets also dole out energy pulses as blasts and arcing grenades which can painfully cling an enemy in plasma fire.</p>
