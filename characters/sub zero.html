      <p>Sub-Zero is a fictional character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. A warrior from the fictional Lin Kuei clan (Chinese: 林魁 pinyin: Lín Kúi), the character is principally defined by his ability to control ice in many forms. He is the only fighter to appear in every main installment of the series, along with being featured as the protagonist of the action-adventure spin-off Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero (1997).The franchise's main Sub-Zero is Kuai Liang (Chinese: 快凉; pinyin: Kuài Liáng). Debuting in Mortal Kombat II (1993), he has used the mantle in every chronological game since his introduction. The mantle was previously used in the original 1992 game and Mythologies by his older brother Bi-Han (Chinese: 避寒; pinyin: Bì Hán), who appears in subsequent installments as Noob Saibot. In contrast with Bi-Han's anti-heroic and later villainous role in the franchise, the main Sub-Zero is depicted as one of the heroic fighters defending Earthrealm against various threats. Sub-Zero also appears as both a rival and ally of the undead specter Scorpion.One of Mortal Kombat's signature characters, Sub-Zero has appeared in various related media outside of the games. He has received acclaim for his appearance, abilities, and Fatality finishing moves.</p>
