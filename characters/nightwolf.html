      <h3>NightWolf</h3>
      <img align="center" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ad/NightwolfRenderMK11.png">
      <p>Nightwolf (born Grey Cloud) is a fictional character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. He debuted in Mortal Kombat 3 (1995) as a Native American shaman selected to help defend Earthrealm against invading forces from Outworld. In addition to his fighting prowess, Nightwolf possesses magical abilities that allow him to enhance his strength and create weapons.The character has appeared in various media outside of the games, including as one of the central heroes in the animated series Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm (1996). His portrayal in the franchise has been criticized as stereotype of Native Americans, although his depiction in the rebooted games has received a more positive reception.</p>
      <h3>Powers and Abilities</h3>
      <p>Initially just one of Earth's chosen souls, Nightwolf was revealed to be his tribe's shaman in Deception's Konquest mode. This role has been reiterated and expanded upon, along with fine-tuning of his techniques.Nightwolf's most common abilities include green magic manipulation and lightning manipulation. By using his power over green energy, Nightwolf can energize himself or his equipped weapons for maximum damage and summon lethal weapons in the form of tomahawks, daggers and bows. This power can be used defensively in the form of a massive bubble shield that covers his entire front (as seen in MK 2011) or a green aura that redirects projectile attacks once they come into contact with it. His power over lightning is much more basic than his green energy, as he only uses it to summon powerful cloud-to-ground lightning that augments his weapons and scorches his foes. A lesser known ability of Nightwolf includes the ability to disintegrate his opponent in a beam of light. This was further expanded in later titles as a last resort, self-destructive spell that requires an incantation that unleashes devastating light capable of harming even Elder Gods such as Cetrion.In Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm, Nightwolf is shown to be rather quite tech-savvy, serving as the group's technician. He is also the operator, monitoring events worldwide while being to keep track of opening portals through a console. He is accompanied by a pet wolf named Kiba, whom he bonds with to transform into his familiar appearance and utilize his shaman powers should the need arise for him to personally intervene or defend the base from invasion. Fitting for his name, Nightwolf also has a close relationship with wolves and is able to communicate with them. In Mortal Kombat Annihilation, he is able to assume the shape of a wolf.In Mortal Kombat: Deception, Nightwolf has the ability to manipulate evil energies, which is the taint in the soul that allows it to enter the Netherrealm. The game also mentions that Nightwolf becomes a Sin Eater, allowing him to completely absorb evil energies whilst retaining his psyche. He utilizes the sins of his ancestors for this purpose: the accumulated evil weighes down the soul of any being - regardless of their powers - to bowels of the Netherrealm. He binds Onaga to the hellish realm in the exact moment Shujinko slays him.In Mortal Kombat 11, The name "Nightwolf" is revealed to be a ceremonial title passed down from individual to individual of the Matoka Tribe by their Great Spirit. Through this moniker bestowal, Grey Cloud has access to a host of supernatural powers reminiscent to those in prior MK games but with wider pronunciation in their application. He still has access to the green force which various other fighters possess, enhancing his natural resilience and assault capability, but also uses it differently than most. Nightwolf is also shown to infuse his shaman magic into his weapons, causing them to turn blue. This magic causes his weapons to electrocute and call down lightning on afflicted targets. It also has the ability to generate blue colored flames.New skills shown in MK11 are his heightened spiritual connection which enables him to imbibe on the power of his spirit animals to increase his own physical abilities or give status ailments to his enemies. The ferocity of Kiba the Wolf augments his physical might strengthening overall attack power, Komo the Bear's ursine strength bolsters his defensive ability to lessen damage taken in battle and the majestic spirit of Hana the Eagle is another ranged attack with which Nightwolf both uses to disorient adversaries or keep her stationary to further augment himself.</p>
