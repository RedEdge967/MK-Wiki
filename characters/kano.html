      <h3>Kano</h3>
      <img align="center" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/81/KanoMKXrender.png">
      <p>Kano is a fictional character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. Debuting in the original 1992 game, he is the leader of the Black Dragon, a fictional criminal organization. Kano is distinguished by his cybernetic eye, which he has used as a laser in later installments. As one of the series' recurring villains, he often aligns himself with the forces threatening Earthrealm. He is also the archenemy of Special Forces officer Sonya Blade, who seeks to bring him to justice.The character has appeared in various media outside of the games, including the 1995 film adaptation and the 2021 film. Reception to the character has been mainly positive; his heart rip Fatality in the first game is regarded as one of the franchise's most iconic.</p>
      <h3>Powers and Abilities</h3>
      <p>Kano isn't the most disciplined fighter but has proven himself to be a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, having received extensive training in Street Fighting, Military Combat and has trained under the Martial Arts of Xing Yi, Aikido, but tends to resort to more of a Street Brawler style of fighting. He is not above utilizing underhanded tactics to get the upper hand in a fight. Kano is an opportunistic fighter and tends to engage in fights when it best suits him, but if challenged directly he will not shy away from the challenge. What he lacks in discipline (finesse & footwork), he makes up for it by being extremely adept in combat and has proven to be a challenge for even the more skilled fighters. What differentiates Kano from his opponents, however, is his dependence on Weapons/Technology rather than Special Powers. He is highly proficient at using knives in combat and often carries multiple bladed weapons on him at once. He has a signature pair of knives he uses in combat, whether they are thrown at the opponent or uses them in hand-to-hand combat. In addition to his fighting skills, Kano has been outfitted with cybernetic enhancements throughout his body, most notably his Cybernetic Eye which can emit a laser beam. His other enhancements help boost his power in combat.Although Kano depends mostly on Weapons/Technology rather than special moves, he does have a Special Ability to tuck himself into a "Cannonball" and propel himself toward his opponents knocking them down. This has been a signature move of his since the first game. Also, several of his finishers involve him ripping vital organs (or sometimes entire skeletons) out of the opponent's body. Along with the elder Sub-Zero's Spine Rip Fatality, Kano's Heart Rip helped Mortal Kombat garner significant controversy over its violence factor.As of Mortal Kombat X, Kano's cybernetics have been upgraded and extended through his entire body. This includes a cybernetic "heart" similar to Hsu Hao, which serves as a booster to his cybernetic enhancements. He now uses thermal grenades as part of his already deadly arsenal.</p>
