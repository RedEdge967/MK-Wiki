      <p>Noob Saibot is a fictional character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. Initially introduced as a black silhouette of the series' other male ninjas and sharing their special moves, he was given his own unique moveset and appearance in later games. His name is derived from the surnames of Mortal Kombat creators Ed Boon and John Tobias spelled backwards.As Noob Saibot, the character debuted as a hidden opponent in Mortal Kombat II (1993) and became playable in the console versions of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (1996). He is first depicted as an undead wraith and member of the malevolent Brotherhood of the Shadow cult. His backstory was further expanded in Mortal Kombat: Deception (2004), where he is revealed as Bi-Han, the elder Sub-Zero from the original 1992 game.Reception to the character has been generally positive, particularly in regard to his Fatality finishing moves. He has also appeared in various media outside of the games.</p>
      <h3>Powers and Abilities</h3>
      <p>When he was still the Cryomancer Sub-Zero, Bi-Han possessed incredible control over the element of ice. He could easily deep freeze opponents with temperatures of -500Â° Fahrenheit [3] (which surpasses even absolute zero) to the point of them becoming brittle enough to shatter into pieces. He was able to flash-freeze opponents with a single touch and had the ability to freeze the air in a large area around him by concentrating all of his power into one destructive blast. His powers were similar, if not superior, to his younger brother's cryomancy. Like his brother, he could create ice weapons when taking the offensive (swords, daggers, spikes, orbs, etc.) and ice constructs when switching to a more defensive style (clones, traps, and armor).His transformation to the wraith Noob Saibot did not immediately grant him new abilities; his first appearance in Mortal Kombat 2 had him borrow moves from other ninjas. It wouldn't be until Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 that Noob fully came into his own, harnessing the powers of darkness and shadow against his foes.Noob displays a mastery over the powers of darkness and is able to turn invisible, create weapon constructs, and summon a shadow clone of himself to assist in battle. This allows him to overwhelm opponents who fight on their own. His clone was replaced by Cyber Smoke in Mortal Kombat: Deception, who had a similar role in combat but had his own set of powers and could summon Noob when needed. In the latest installment, he can duplicate and teleport to his shadow clone for an advantage in numbers and mobility respectively. The clone can also be summoned inside live opponents to bypass external defenses by pouring dark energy into them, tearing them apart from the inside.Like most ninjas, Noob has the ability to teleport. In older games, his teleportation required the use of dark portals which he could also use on unlucky opponents who were caught in them. His usage of teleportation and portals was expanded on in Mortal Kombat (2011) and in Mortal Kombat 11. He could turn into liquid and reform elsewhere, use portals to reposition himself or his opponent, and even kill by crushing and disintegrating those who are caught in his portal. Noob honed his bunshin techniques as well; summoning multiple clones to restrain enemies. He used such techniques upon Jax and Jacqui when they returned to Shang Tsung's Island to retrieve the crown.His weapons of choice are shurikens. He initially was to have these weapons, along with a scythe, in Mortal Kombat 4, but was replaced with Reiko. However, he begins using such weapons in Mortal Kombat: Deception. He also utilises a sickle as his main weapon in Mortal Kombat 11.In his current form as a Wraith, Noob possesses a degree of immortality. This was demonstrated when he survived being thrown into the Soulnado by Cyber Sub-Zero. Noob was able to withstand the vortex and absorb the souls swirling around it, using them to fuel his power. In addition, the sickle he wields is lodged into his heart, but he appears to be unaffected as the weapon is frequently sheathed and unsheathed.</p>
