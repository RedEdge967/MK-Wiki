      <h3>Scorpion</h3>
      <img align="center" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6c/ScorpionMKXRender.png">
      <p>Scorpion ("né" Hanzo Hasashi) is a fictional character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. An undead ninja, he is principally defined by his quest to avenge the deaths of himself, his family, and his clan. His signature weapon is a kunai-rope dart, which he uses to harpoon opponents, as he shouts his infamous battle cry, "Get over here!"Debuting in the original 1992 game, Scorpion has appeared in every main installment except Mortal Kombat 3 (1995). The character's backstory establishes him as Hanzo Hasashi (Japanese: 波佐志 半蔵), a warrior from the fictional Shirai Ryu clan who was killed by Bi-Han of the rival Lin Kuei clan. Subsequent games reveal that his family and clan were murdered by the sorcerer Quan Chi, who becomes Scorpion's primary target for vengeance. Depicted as a neutral party in most games, Scorpion generally forgoes the franchise's main conflicts to pursue his personal missions, which sometimes results in him taking the side that will help his objective. He is also both a rival and ally of Kuai Liang, the franchise's main Sub-Zero.Scorpion has received critical acclaim since his debut and frequently appears in media outside of the games. He is regarded as Mortal Kombat's most iconic fighter; series co-creator Ed Boon cites Scorpion as his favorite character. </p>
      <h3>Powers and Abilities</h3>
      <p>Scorpion is most commonly associated with Hellfire, the Netherrealm's variant of fire. Scorpion is immune to the element and primarily uses it to confirm the death of his opponents, spewing it from his skull while unmasked. He is very versatile with this element, for he can summon it under his opponent, light himself up with hellfire to create a damaging aura of flames and hurl fireballs that can explode. His other abilities include necromancy and summoning. After being betrayed by the Elder Gods when they resurrected his clan as undead, he still found use from his undead comrades known as Hellspawns, who are capable of summoning hellfire as well. His summoning abilities allow him to call upon demonic minions that can self-destruct and floating skull creatures that breathe hellfire and spew explosive projectiles.As a spectre, Scorpion is immune to death as his soul is still bound by revenge, allowing him to endlessly chase his targets until they have been silenced. He is capable of resurrection, even if his physical body is fully destroyed, as demonstrated in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance where he was supposedly killed by Quan Chi when he kicked him into a pool of acid in the map Acid Bath, but later returned to life in order to find the Deadly Alliance and their minions. He also came back to life in the Mortal Kombat X comic series after Havik brutally killed him by destroying his chest and lungs.Scorpion has the ability to teleport and can activate this ability without doing a gesture but by doing a mere thought instead, often used in the form of surprise or ambush attacks, and can open portals to the Netherrealm at will. The scope of Scorpion's powers depend on how long he remains in his abode, the Netherrealm. This proved advantageous when he pursued Quan Chi in the depths of hell, whose magic is diminished by the power and nature of the realm.After being fully resurrected, it's revealed in the Mortal Kombat X comic series that Scorpion's wraith powers and Hellfire depend on his own emotional pain, as he must relive his greatest shame like the destruction of his family and clan or witness his allies suffering, like Takeda seemingly dying, in order to use it. By doing so, Hanzo becomes more wraith like, surrounded by hellfire, and his powers increase tremendously to the point they can even exceed deities in combat like Raiden. Although powerful, there is a drawback to every time Hanzo uses his powers; if he uses hellfire for too long, he risks being consumed by it, destroying his existence. Along with this, Hanzo's Scorpion persona can overtake him, resulting in him acting less reasonable and more hostile.Like many ninjas, Scorpion is well-versed in the art of armed combat. He has wielded various weapons throughout the tournaments, from axes to the most recent twin Ninjato. His most recurring weapon is the Spear, a kunai attached to a sturdy rope. Colloquially called a kyoketsu-shoge in ancient Japan, representing Scorpion's "stinger". At times, the spear is empowered with hellfire for more power. Various depictions of the spear had been made before Deadly Alliance. It was shown as a chain tied to a mace in the comics. His spear was a sentient, serpentine creature that spawned from within his hand during the films. He is empowered by the Elder Gods to defeat Onaga in Deception. However, Shujinko slays Onaga before he gets the chance.In the latest installment, Mortal Kombat 11, Scorpion has gained new powers and abilities. He can burn away his own flesh, revealing a fiery skeleton that can phase through physical matter and burn, sometimes vaporize, anything he touches, making him difficult to harm physically. This implies that he has a powerful healing factor that can regenerate all of the flesh he burnt away. Scorpion can also manipulate wind to create a fiery tornado of hellfire, although it is unknown if this ability can be used for combat. His teleport can now produce afterimages that act like solid duplicates as shown in one of his moves where he leaves an afterimage behind to hold the opponent's arm before disintegrating. He can also create afterimages to trick opponents of his next move. His affinity with fire is so potent that he is completely immune to Sektor's high-power flamethrower, calmly walking through the jet-powered fire without even so much as a singe on his skin or clothing.</p>
