      <p>Scorpion ("né" Hanzo Hasashi) is a fictional character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. An undead ninja, he is principally defined by his quest to avenge the deaths of himself, his family, and his clan. His signature weapon is a kunai-rope dart, which he uses to harpoon opponents, as he shouts his infamous battle cry, "Get over here!"Debuting in the original 1992 game, Scorpion has appeared in every main installment except Mortal Kombat 3 (1995). The character's backstory establishes him as Hanzo Hasashi (Japanese: 波佐志 半蔵), a warrior from the fictional Shirai Ryu clan who was killed by Bi-Han of the rival Lin Kuei clan. Subsequent games reveal that his family and clan were murdered by the sorcerer Quan Chi, who becomes Scorpion's primary target for vengeance. Depicted as a neutral party in most games, Scorpion generally forgoes the franchise's main conflicts to pursue his personal missions, which sometimes results in him taking the side that will help his objective. He is also both a rival and ally of Kuai Liang, the franchise's main Sub-Zero.Scorpion has received critical acclaim since his debut and frequently appears in media outside of the games. He is regarded as Mortal Kombat's most iconic fighter; series co-creator Ed Boon cites Scorpion as his favorite character. </p>
