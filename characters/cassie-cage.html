      <h3>Cassie Cage</h3>
      <img align="center" src="https://mk11moves.com/img/characters/crops/cassie-cage.png">
      <p>Some time after the Netherrealm War, Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade got married and had a daughter, Cassie. However, Sonya's perceived prioritization of work over her own family led them to divorce, much to Cassie's sadness. Being the daughter of a high-earning Hollywood actor, Cassie was somewhat spoiled, although her attitude changed after she was kidnapped by the Black Dragon. This experience convinced her to join the Special Forces, where she would be trained by both of her parents in combat.Inheriting the charisma and cocky wit of her father and the stern, tough as nails attitude of her mother, Cassie quickly rose through the ranks to become team leader and, eventually, sergeant. She managed to defeat the fallen Elder God Shinnok single-handedly, even in his full demonic form, and eventually attained the rank of commander.Initially, Cassie harbored deep insecurities, fearing that she might not be able to live up to her parents' legacy and expectations, especially her mother's. But over time, Cassie developed into a more confident leader with the aid of her friends.Despite her brash demeanor, she has a deep sense of morality, refusing to kill opponents except when absolutely necessary. She also shows genuine respect for her elders and masters, as seen while approaching Sub-Zero. She is childhood friends with Jacqui Briggs, who is also part of the team she leads along with Kung Jin and Takeda Takahashi. Like her father, Cassie has shadow abilities, but would not fully master them until her encounter with Shinnok.She is a stereotypical millennial, sporting many of the most iconic trends and technologies of her generation, including iPods, social media, and digital phones.</p>
      <h3>Powers and Abilities</h3>
      <p>As the daughter of Sonya Blade and Johnny Cage, Cassie has received Special Forces training from her mother, while gaining her father's fighting style and super human abilities. Her skills with green energy have improved greatly by the time of MK11, now being able to infuse it into objects, as seen in her Fatal Blow. She also gains a combat drone BLB-118 that assists her during combat.</p>
