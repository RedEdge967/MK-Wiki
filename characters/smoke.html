      <p>Smoke is a fictional character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. He debuted in Mortal Kombat II (1993) as a hidden opponent and became a secret playable character in Mortal Kombat 3 (1995), making him the franchise's first unlockable fighter. In keeping with his namesake, he is distinguished by the smoke fumes emitting from his body and his smoke-based powers.A member of the fictional Lin Kuei clan, Smoke has been depicted as both a human ninja and a cyborg in the series. He is also a close friend of fellow Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero. The character's original storyline sees him forcibly transformed into a cyborg by his clan, but retains his human soul, which allows him to join Sub-Zero in defending Earthrealm. However, following the events of Mortal Kombat 3, Smoke is reprogrammed into serving Sub-Zero's evil brother Noob Saibot. In the rebooted timeline, he avoids automation, but becomes an undead revenant in service of the Netherrealm.Smoke has appeared in various media outside of the games, including the 1997 film Mortal Kombat: Annihilation. Reception to the character, particularly his human version, has been generally positive.</p>
      <h3>Powers and Abilities</h3>
      <p>Of all the three cyborg ninjas, Smoke appears to specialize in stealth and speed. His powers as a human were unknown for the most part, but in both forms, his body emits a constant smoky fume, probably to obscure his movements from the opponent. In MKII, he was depicted as moving at extremely high speeds, much faster than the other two hidden ninjas. From Mortal Kombat: Deception onward, Smoke is seen using smoke-related attacks, such as causing his opponent to cough as well as teleporting. In later appearances, due to Smoke's cybernetic "upgrades", his body appears to effectively be made out of smoke, or at least his nanomachines emulate the appearance of it. Whatever the case, due to further modifications made on his body by Noob Saibot, he has become a demon nonetheless. In Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, he is seen to be able to mind control other people by inserting his gaseous mist into them.In Mortal Kombat (2011), Smoke remains in his human form and his abilities are explored deeper. It is revealed in his ending that he is in fact an enenra, a demonic creature composed entirely of smoke and vapor. As such, he is able to not only actively utilize his namesake as an extensive weapon, but he is also able to morph his entire body into a cloud of vapor, allowing him to move swiftly around his opponent as well as escape from enemies or potential captors. As shown in his Fatalities, his smoke also emits extreme levels of heat.In the second live-action film, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, Smoke is armed with rockets, like Sektor, and has the ability to transform himself into smoke in order to ambush his enemies.</p>
