      <h3>Takeda</h3>
      <img align="center" src="https://preview.redd.it/aussn04yz1w51.png?auto=webp&s=855dc8572cdd267407de9cbd02af5dd3a73638ed">
      <p>Takeda lived a normal life in Thailand with his mother, Suchin, despite his father not knowing of his existence until he was a child. After his mother was killed by the Red Dragon, he was entrusted to Hanzo when his father left to avenge her death. Although he is taught the ways of a warrior, Takeda originally had a timid nature and didn't take fighting seriously. However, after the newest iteration of the Shirai Ryu are eradicated, he becomes more serious and continues to help his master, both in missions and preventing him from giving in to his wraith persona.After many years, Takeda completed his training with Scorpion and, at the urging of both his mentor and his father who returned for him, joined a new team formed by the Special Forces dedicated to protecting Earthrealm. Consisting of a new generation of heroes, Takeda developed a great friendship with all in his team and is often the one who stops arguments from erupting between them, such as with Cassie Cage and Kung Jin. Takeda is also in a romantic relationship with Jacqui Briggs. He ultimately proves his heroism and bravery when he confronts all the revenants (along with Jacqui) at the Sky Temple in order for the rest of his team to stop Shinnok, despite his injuries.Takeda is shown to take his battles seriously, but does make wise cracks during so. He expresses great loyalty to the Shirai Ryu, as he continues to wear a yellow-orange headband to show his connection to the clan and will fight any who threatens his clan. He has even stated that the Shirai Ryu are his family. Despite not trusting Hanzo at first because he was a wraith, Takeda becomes immensely loyal to his master over the years and sees Hanzo as a father-figure. While Kenshi is his biological father, Takeda originally didn't trust him and preferred not to speak about him.Whilst he doesn’t make a playable appearance in Mortal Kombat 11, Takeda cameos in various tower endings. Additionally, in an intro dialogue between Jacqui and Scorpion, it is revealed that Jacqui and Takeda are engaged.</p>
      <h3>Powers and Abilities</h3>
      <p>Takeda is a trained warrior, the apprentice of Scorpion himself, and has shown great skill with using bladed whips and plasma empowered swords in combat, referencing both his teacher Scorpion and his father Kenshi. His serrated edged whips are concealed in his gauntlets, and are launched at high powered speed for maximum striking power. He has also shown the power to teleport in a similar manner to his master, Scorpion. Like his father, Kenshi, Takeda has shown some telekinetic abilities by being able to move his plasma swords with his mind, and possesses some telepathic power as well, able to read minds and overload senses with enough concentration. Unlike his mentor and father, Takeda has the unique ability to form an orange, plasma-like aura around parts of his body and weapons to inflict further damage against his opponents.During the events of the Mortal Kombat X comic series, Takeda gains a set of equipment blessed by Fujin using the Jinsei's powerful life energy which was also infused to his soul, giving him a tremendous power boost that allowed to fight against and endure attacks from the likes of Sonya Blade, Johnny Cage, Kotal Kahn, Mileena, Raiden and Havik who were possessed and strengthened by Blood Magik. Even a continuous blast of power from the Amulet of Shinnok did not instantly disintegrate and kill him due to the Jinsei energy charged into his soul.</p>
