      <p>Ko'atal, most commonly referred to as Kotal Kahn or just simply Kotal, is a character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game series. A powerful, high ranking Osh-Tekk, he is the former Emperor of Outworld, serving as the realm's Emperor after the death of Shao Kahn.Kotal Kahn made his playable debut in Mortal Kombat X, serving as a tertiary antagonist in the game's Story Mode opposite to Shinnok and Quan Chi.Kotal Kahn returned in Mortal Kombat 11 as a playable character while also serving as a supporting character in the game's Story Mode.</p>
      <h3>Powers and Abilities</h3>
      <p>As an Osh-Tekk, Kotal Kahn is incredibly powerful, possessing super-human strength allowing him to smash a grown man's head into bits of bone and gore with ease while also allowing him to wield his massive Macuahuitl with a single hand. As an Osh-Tekk, he can draw power from sunlight to strengthen himself and heal his wounds, while also being able to use it to directly harm enemies in beams of solar fire or even imbue his weapons with for more damage. In MK11 he also has the ability to turn himself into a black jaguar whilst still wearing his headpiece to maul his opponent at will. Kotal Kahn also has the ability to use telekinesis, but it is not as potent as other wielders, such as Ermac, since he is limited to restraining people only.With Outworld's Kamidogu, he can invoke Blood Magik to further strengthen himself and his natural abilities over sunlight. While in his Blood God state, he was able to call down an intense beam of solar flames through storm clouds summoned by the Edenian demigod, Rain, and physically overpower and cut off Goro's arms. His power has been compared to that of a God by humans from Earthrealm. Additionally with his use of Blood Magik, Kotal Kahn can empower himself by drawing his own blood or the opponent's and can even heal himself by absorbing the opponent's blood.Fitting to his Aztec/Mayan inspired design, Kotal has the ability to summon totems that empower him during battle. These totems can be used as sources of power that boosts his damage and reduces the damage he takes. One of his totems has the ability to absorb spilled blood and use it to heal Kotal himself. Said totems can be used as improvised weapons as shown in his Fatal Blow.Like all Osh-Tekk he is physically weakened when deprived of sunlight, and unable to call on its power. Kotal Kahn is also capable of teleporting in a burst of smoke and flames, though this is not a gameplay element.</p>
