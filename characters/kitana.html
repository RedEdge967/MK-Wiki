      <h3>Kitana</h3>
      <img align="center" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/20/KitanaMK11.png">
      <p>Kitana is a fictional character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. Debuting in Mortal Kombat II (1993), she is a royal from the fictional realm of Edenia. Her primary weapon is a pair of steel fans, which she uses for most of her special attacks.The character is introduced as the daughter of Outworld emperor Shao Kahn until she learns her true father was murdered by Shao Kahn when he conquered Edenia. Kitana subsequently becomes a primary hero in the series, joining forces with the Earthrealm warriors as she fights to ensure her realm's liberation. She is also the love interest of Mortal Kombat hero Liu Kang.One of the franchise's most iconic and popular fighters, Kitana has appeared in various media outside of the games. She has received a positive reception for her appearance, personality, and character development.</p>
      <h3>Powers and Abilities</h3>
      <p>Kitana relies mostly on her Steel Fans in battle, although she is more than adequate in unarmed hand-to-hand combat. She can use her fans as both a projectile and a melee weapon, as well as the ability to create large and small Tornadoes with her Edenian/Wind magic, ( She expresses her magic with her War Fans) Kitana also has the ability to Teleport short/long distances and somewhat has flight to an extent. She can also throw her fans while airborne and execute a midair punch to counter other airborne foes. This made her one of the most powerful characters in Mortal Kombat II, and was subsequently toned down in later games. In Armageddon, she can also teleport and launch herself forward with a series of kicks to the opponent.Throughout the series, she has been shown to be more powerful than her evil twin Mileena, and has defeated her several times. She is also a very strong leader; she succeeded in recruiting Sindel back to her side and convince her of Shao Kahn's evil during the events of Mortal Kombat 3, and has done the same to Goro in Mortal Kombat Gold.</p>
