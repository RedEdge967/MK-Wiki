      <h3>Sindel</h3>
      <img align="center" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/16/Sindel-MK11.png">
      <p>Sindel is a fictional character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. Debuting in Mortal Kombat 3 (1995), she is queen of the fictional realm of Edenia. She possesses the ability to create sonic screams and can also use her hair as a weapon.In the games' original storyline, Sindel is forced into marriage with Outworld emperor Shao Kahn after he conquers her realm. Brainwashed into helping Shao Kahn invade Earthrealm, she turns against him with the aid of her daughter Kitana. The rebooted timeline, however, depicts Sindel as the loyal queen and lover of Shao Kahn. Outside of the games, Sindel has appeared in various related media, including the 1997 film Mortal Kombat: Annihilation. Reception to the character has been generally positive for her appearance and special moves, although her villainous role in the reboot drew sharp criticism.</p>
      <h3>Powers and Abilities</h3>
      <p>Being an Edenian, Sindel possesses an array of mystical abilities. One of her trademark abilities is her ultrasonic, super-loud screaming. The strength and its properties seem to differ on the focus. This ranges from sonic blasts to a fierce sound wave that can outright blast an opponent's skin clean off. She can tone this down to a degree to paralyze the unwary. Another of her mystical powers is her prehensile hair which can be used as both a throw and a finisher in Mortal Kombat 3, where it would grow to extremely long lengths and be able to wrap itself around the opponent to throw and sometimes constrict them. Another of Sindel's distinguishing characteristics is her ability to levitate. Apart from serving as her win pose, she can use this to evade enemy attacks and deal damage simultaneously.In Mortal Kombat 11, according to Kronika, Sindel is one among few mortal beings who has the abilities to harm an Elder God, as this was proven during her battle against Cetrion.</p>
