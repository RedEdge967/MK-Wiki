      <p>Mileena is a fictional character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. Introduced in Mortal Kombat II (1993), she is a clone of the Edenian princess Kitana, created with the blood of the fictional Tarkatan species. Her creation results in her developing the deformed facial features of the Tarkatan, which she conceals with a veil. A power-hungry, unstable villain throughout most of the series, Mileena uses a pair of sai as her primary weapons. She is also the love interest of the Tarkatan warrior Baraka or Edenian traiter Tanya.Despite some criticism for her revealing character designs, Mileena has received a positive reception for her unique appearance and personality. She has been featured in various media outside of the games and is one of the franchise's most popular characters.</p>
      <h3>Powers and Abilities</h3>
      <p>Mileena, half Edenian, half Tarkatan, has proven that she is a deadly combination of beauty and beast. She has been shown to be able to fight with brute strength rivaling that of a Shokan, if not surpassing it, and has shown an incredible amount of agility and acrobatic prowess. In addition, she possesses incredible speed, making her one of the deadliest kombatants in the whole series. Mileena wields a pair of Sai and is able to teleport, roll, and bite the opponent with her deadly Tarkatan teeth. Because of her being Kitana's clone, she almost is equal in strength to her. In Mortal Kombat (2011), Mileena does not have the same knowledge of martial arts as her former version but replaces it with more wild, fierce attacks that make her exactly the same or even deadlier in terms of ferocity, although she is more mentally unstable.Being Kitana's clone, Mileena possesses incredible combat strength, aptitude, and agility like her sister. What separates her from Kitana, though, is her weapon of choice in the sai. She exhibits proficiency with the Sai that is equivalent to Kitana's with her fans. Coupled with the Tarkatan blood coursing through her veins and physique that allows for superb agility, this makes Mileena one of the most vicious and deadly characters in the entire series.As shown in Mortal Kombat (2011), Mileena becomes enshrouded in a pink, flame-like aura when executing her signature techniques, including the Rolling Thunder, Soaring Sai and Kick From Above.In Mortal Kombat X, her powers have developed further, granting her the ability to instantly warp towards sais she has thrown on the ground through a variation called Ethereal.Mortal Kombat 11 further expands her abilities, bringing back legacy moves with more twists and adding completely new powers to her arsenal. Some of her moves that are normally cloaked in her signature pink aura in the modern games are mixed with a second layer of aura that is colored blue. While the backstory behind this change is unknown, it is likely a reference to her hybrid nature. She has gained new ways to attack opponents with her sai projectiles such as placing them on the ground to erupt from below the enemy and magically summon sai daggers out of thin air that strike opponents from multiple angles. Complimenting her assassin character, Mileena has the ability to turn completely invisible albeit she is covered in an magic aura that gives away her position. This drawback is compensated by her body being completely invisible even during attacks, making her foes oblivious to whatever she is going to do next.</p>
